(1) Rosanes–Anderssen Breslau, 1862 Falkbeer Counter Gambit [C32] 1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.e×d5 e4 4.Bb5+ This move is characteristic of the old-time player. The game was played without consideration of the fine positional qualities and the player was concerned mainly with obvious material advantages or mating attacks. Today we know that the primary object of the struggle in the opening is the control of the center. A modern player therefore aims first of all at the removal of the oppressive e4-pawn and for this reason naturally plays 4.d3 In this game White as was customary at that time attempts to establish first his preponderance in pawns, even at the expense of his development and therefore plays 4.Bb5+, in order to exchange the d5-pawn which otherwise might become weak, after c3. 4...c6 5.d×c6 N×c6 The exchange of the pawn was here usually accompanied with 5...b×c6. 6.Nc3 Nf6 7.Qe2 White would have done better to move the d-pawn in order to make up as much as possible for his rather backward development. White instead continues to play for material gain, namely the capture of a second pawn, the e-pawn. Black is quite justified in not defending this pawn, but to continue his development instead. The more pawns are eliminated from the board and the more lines are opened thereby, the greater will be his advantage in development. 7...Bc5 8.N×e4 0-0 9.B×c6 b×c6 10.d3 Re8 11.Bd2 In castling on the queenside, White is attempting to guard his king against possible danger. Black, however, has too many open lines on the queenside. 11...N×e4 12.d×e4 Bf5 13.e5 Qb6 After 13...B×c2 and 14.Qc4 Black would have to exchange one of his valuable bishops, but in view of White’s undeveloped position, even this continuation would be advantageous for Black. 14.0-0-0 Bd4 This move weakens White’s castled position. 15.c3 Rab8 16.b3 16...Red8 A quiet waiting move quite in the Anderssen manner and preparing a brilliant combination, which is completely overlooked by his opponent. 17.Nf3 Had White seen through his adversary’s plan, he would have played 17.Kb2, although Black would have won speedily with 17...Be6, threatening 18...B×b3. 17...Q×b3! 18.a×b3 R×b3 19.Be1 Be3+! and mate next move. 0-1
